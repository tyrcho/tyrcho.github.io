I gave a try to this [scala to javascript compiler](http://www.scala-js.org/) last night, 
and was quite amazed by the level of maturity this has already reached !

While probably never a replacement for mainline javascript in web sites, 
I see this as a competitor to coffeescript for web applications.

Full demo of [scala-js-fiddle](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/) so you can experiment with scala directly in your browser, 
with some IDE-like features.

[This implementation](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/gist/d02aca0ec27589852728/langton.scala) of 
[Langtonâ€™s ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) is what I achieved from scratch in 20 min.
